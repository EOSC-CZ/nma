    this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed,
    exposed and shared across different applications. This linking structure forms
    a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two
    resources, represented by the graph nodes.

  en: extension of the HTML language designed for representing legal acts; it provides
    an explicit domain language addressing all structural aspects of an act such as
    articles, paragraphs, items and references; it also supports the description of
    the editorial and jurisdictional history of an act and the semantic annotation
    of domain entities; furthermore, LegalHTML addresses the consolidation of an act
    and its subsequent modifications into a single document using a tree-like representation
    of the original content and of its modified versions; finally, a JavaScript API
    enhances the representation as an active document, enabling the visualization
    of a consolidated act as it applies at different points in time
